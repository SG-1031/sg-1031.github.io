    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an Administrative Assistant and Computer Operator with 12+ years of experience across municipal government and education.
      I specialize in customer service, records management, and technical support—bridging the gap between people and technology.
      Over the years I’ve supported high-volume government operations, maintained accurate vital records, and kept systems running
      smoothly through hardware/software setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance.
